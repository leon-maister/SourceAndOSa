once it hooks the reader on the power of coldfusion, the book illustrates the product''s flexibility in dealing with e-mail, ftp, ldap servers, and custom tags. it goes on to cover the coldfusion studio integrated-development environment--though not in depth. the real focus of this book is how the coldfusion language works.
